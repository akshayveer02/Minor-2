I have attached the project source code.
In this basically we have processed the image using Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)  machine learning  model, with this we have implented about 200 epochs and in output we can clearly see thedifference in output image as well as input image which low resolution image.

INPUT IMAGES:

lowres1, lowres2, small_image_3_channels.
